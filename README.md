# To-Do

To-Do is a simple Android application that helps you make to-do lists with the ability to add a description for each task. Also, you can add subtasks if needed. To edit/add new subtasks, you just press once on the task. The application can follow your device theme automatically, and you can choose to turn dark mode on and off manually too.

The application is made with Material You design in mind, which means it supports dynamic color and a themed icon. Also, it supports the predictive back gesture.

Disclaimer: dynamic color and the themed icon are only supported on Android 12+, while the predictive back gesture is only supported on Android 13+.
